#### Week 1

**Compiling REAPER (Robust Epoch And Pitch EstimatoR)**

REAPER (https://github.com/google/REAPER) is said to be good for f0 extraction. However, the compiling needs some level of programming literacy. I wrote a step-by-step tutorial for the compilation.

#### Week 2

**collect all f0 listing.praat**

This is a Praat script to collect f0 values (can also extract intensity and formants with modification). 

This script can both run in Praat and in command line. Running it in command line is highly recommended since it is much faster.



#### Week 3

**collect f0 listing by speaker.praat**

This is a Praat script to collect f0 values with a specified speaker (can also extract intensity and formants with modification). 

This script can both run in Praat and in command line. Running it in command line is highly recommended since it is much faster.





#### Week 4

**collect listing by gender.praat**

This is a Praat script to collect f0 values with different f0 ranges set for different genders and extracts intensity (can also extract formants with modification). 

This script can both run in Praat and in command line. Running it in command line is highly recommended since it is much faster.
